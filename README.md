### Project Description
It is basically for the dating of college students, students can date other students based on the grading, hobbies and skills of the students 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Normally dating is not based on the grading and skills of the person, that what we focused to build on



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Initially we had planned to use 'Appwrite' which is a commonly known backend service provider (BaaS) for the api request and so on, but turned out to be a worst nightmare since they hade multiple restriction is creating cloud/edge functions as well as trouble in database connectivity. Due to those facts, we had to migrate the entire program to Node JS.

But that doesn't ends there, later we faced a serious trouble in the frontend part, where figma literaly declined to convert our design to react. This made up a huge burden which made this entire on a clueless as well as a useless project.
